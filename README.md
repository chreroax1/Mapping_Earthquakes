# Mapping_Earthquakes
Mapping using JS and API

Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and would like to see the data on a third map, so that is what I did.

Using my knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, I added the tectonic plate data using d3.json(),the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString so they would stand out on the map, and added the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.
